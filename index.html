    <h2>CONCORD</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      The term 'concord' means 'agreement',looking at the image above we all know what it is to agree,but in this context we will be talking about the agreement between a <strong> noun</strong> and a <strong>verb</strong> in a sentence.
      Concord is the agreement or harmony between different part of a sentence,it is said to be the agreement in number and person between the subject of the sentence and its verb.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <span>The man</span> <span>is</span> my Uncle</li>
        <li><span>The men</span> <span>are</span> my Uncles</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Looking at the examples stated above you can unavoidably see the agreement between the noun used in each sentences and the verb used in each sentences. That is the preamble of what concord actually means.<br>Before we continue it is
        necessary to list out most of the auxilliary verbs frequently used both in their singular and plural form so as to facilitate our learning.</p>

      <h3>Singular verb</h3>
      <p>A singular verb has 's'added to it such as;Write<span>s</span>,play<span>s</span>,run<span>s</span>,etc.
        From the image above,the boy is performing an action ie,he is singing(a verb) how can we construct a sentence that involves <strong>the boy</strong> and the action he is performing. </p>
      <h3 class="com">Examples</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>He sing<span>s</span> very well.</li>
        <li>She dance<span>s</span> well.</li>
        <li>She eat<span>s</span> fast.</li>
        <li>She <span>goes</span> to the mosque</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="plu">
      <img class="people" src="sing.png" alt="sing.png-img">
      <h3>Plural verb</h3>
      <p>A plural verb has no 's' added to it and it is usually used when we have a plural noun or pronoun (two or more persons).such verbs include;write,play,run,etc.In order to make a correct sentence,plural noun must be used with a plural verb.
      </p>
      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They <span>sing</span> very well.</li>
        <li>They <span>eat</span> very fast.</li>
        <li>They <span>go</span> to the mosque.</li>

      <h2>RULES OF CONCORD</h2>
      <div class="rules">
        <h3>Rule 1:</h3>
        <img class="medal" src="medal.png" alt="medal-img">
        <p>When a conjunction other than 'and'is used to link two subject,the verb agrees with the first subject of the sentence.
          <br>Examples of conjunctions other than 'and' are; with,together-with,as-well-as,along-with,no-less-than,including,in-collaboration-with,not-to-mention,etc
        </p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ol type="i">
          <li><span class="noun">Jane</span> <span>with</span> her husband <span class="verb">is</span> here now.</li>
          <li><span class="noun">Sadatu</span> <span> as well as</span> the maids <span class="verb">likes</span> plaintain.</li>
          <li><span class="noun">The teacher</span> <span>with</span> his wife <span class="verb">is</span> here.</li>
          <li><span class="noun">The director</span> <span>no less than</span> his workers <span class="verb">is</span> to blame</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note the verbs;<span>is</span> and <span>likes</span> used in the sentences above are singular verb </p>

      </div>
      <div class="rules">
        <h3>Rule 2:</h3>
        <img class="and" src="people.png" alt="and-img">
        <p>When the conjunction "and" is used to join two subjects a plural verb is used.Remember in rule one, two subjects were used and a singular verb was used because the conjunction used was not "and".<br>Note; when "and" is used the verb MUST
          be
          pluralized because it refers to two different people</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ol type="i">
          <li><span class="noun">Jane</span> <span>and</span> her <span class="noun">husband</span> <span class="verb"> are</span> here now. </li>
          <li><span class="noun">Sadiku</span> <span>and</span> the <span class="noun">maids</span> <span class="verb">like</span> plaintain.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Exception</h3>
        <img class="ex" src="ex.png" alt="ex-img">
        <p>When "and" is used to join two singular subjects which refer to the same person and thing , a singular verb is used.<br>Note;this occurs in the abscent of the definite article"The"before the second subject.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ol type="i">
          <li><span class="noun">The player and coach</span> <span class="verb">is</span> in the stadium.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note; A Singular verb "is"was used in the example above because the two subject is being referred to one person(ie with the absent of "the" on the second subject).</p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li><span class="noun">The Emir</span> and <span class="noun">Conqueror</span> of the territories <span class="verb">arrives</span> next week.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note; The Emir is the Conqueror so the two subject is actually referring to one person,hence the singular verb "arrives" is used.</p>
        <h3>Take cognizance:</h3>
        <p>When "the" is added to the second subject, the two singular subjects do no longer refer to the same person or thing , then it will take a plural "verb".</p>
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <ol type="i">
          <li><span class="noun">The player</span> and <span class="noun">the coach</span> <span class="verb">are</span> in the stadium.</li>
          <p>Note; A plural verb "are" is used because the sentence is referring to two different people,and there is a repetition of the definite article"the".</p>
        </ol>

      </div>
      <div class="rules">
        <h3>Rule 3:</h3>
        <img class="proximity" src="proximity.png" alt="proximity-img">
        <p>In this rule we will be talking about Proximity-concord,the word "closeness" can be used in place of proximity for understanding.Looking at the image above you can see how close those people are, the same applies for proximity concord.
          When two different subjects are linked using "either or","neither nor ",no-one-else,etc.The verb agrees with with the subject <strong>closer</strong> to it.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Neither clifford nor his <span class="noun">parents</span> <span class="verb">attend</span> the meeting now.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note; The plural verb "attend" is used because the verb agrees with the subject closer to it(parents) which is plural,ignoring the singular subject (clifford) farther from it.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In my opinion,neither the players nor <span class="noun">the coach</span> <span class="verb">deserves</span> praise for the result of the match.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note; The singular verb "deserves"is used because the verb agrees with the singular subject (coach) close to it , ignoring the plural subject(players) farther from it.And this happens whenever "either or","neither or",etc is used.</p>
        <h3>Take cognizance:</h3>
        <p> When "either" or "neither" is used in a sentence the verb to be used must be singular.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="rules">
        <h3>Rule 4:</h3>
        <img class="who" src="who.png" alt="who-img">
        <p>In this rule agreement of the verb is determined by the noun that comes before the relative pronoun "who", "which", "that",etc.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We all pitied the <span class="noun">man</span> <span> who</span> <span class="verb">was</span> severely injured.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note;The verb agrees with is the noun immediately after the relative pronoun(for sentence that contain relative pronoun).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Joe is one of the <span class="noun">boys</span> <span>who</span> <span class="verb">are</span> clever.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note; The noun that comes before the relative pronoun is plural (boys) therefore a plural noun must agree with a plural verb.</p>
        <h3>Exceptions:</h3>
        <p>when "the only one of the" is present ,here the verb must be singular irrespective of the <strong>noun</strong> or <strong>pronoun</strong> that comes before the relative pronoun</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Joe is <span> the only one of the</span> boys who <span>is</span> clever.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Take a close look at the sentence, the noun that comes before a relative pronoun is supposed to determine the verb but in this case that is ignored because of the present of "the only one of the" in the sentence.</p>
        <h3>2</h3>
        <p>When starting a sentence with "one of" the last verb of the sentence must be singular in agreement with "one" which is also singular.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>One of the rioters who were arrested yesterday <span class="verb">has</span> come.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last verb is singular(has) it agrees with "one of"(which is also singular),the plural verb "were" agrees with the noun before the relative pronoun which is plural as well(rioters).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="rules">
        <h3>Rule 5:</h3>
        <img class="push" src="push.png" alt="push-img">
        <p>When "one of" is used to begin a sentence,it is always followed by a plural <strong>noun</strong> or <strong>pronoun</strong> and a <span>singular verb</span></p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"one of" my <span class="noun">friends</span> <span class="verb">is</span> here.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This one is straight-forward,when "one of" is used it is followed by a plural noun (friends) and a singular verb(is).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One of the <span class="noun">vice-presidents </span> <span class="verb">acts</span> in an interim capacity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to the rule when "one of" begins a sentence it is followed by a plural noun(Vice-President<strong>s</strong>) and a singular verb (acts;Remember,singular verbs have "s")</p>
      </div>
      <div class="rules">
        <h3>Rule 6:</h3>
        <img class="baby" src="baby.png" alt="baby-img">
        <p>When we begin a sentence with a <strong>definite article</strong>"the" followed by an adjective such as ; rich, poor, blind, priviledge handicapped,young,etc.Then a <strong>plural verb</strong> will be used after them. </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="noun">The rich</span> also <span class="verb">cry</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>"The" is a definite article,followed by an adjective (rich), hence the verb that agrees will be plural(Cry).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="noun">The poor</span> <span class="verb">deserve</span> financial assistance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Definite article plus <strong>adjective</strong> agree with a plural verb.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="rules">
        <h3>Rule 7:</h3>
        <img class="num" src="num.png" alt="num-img">
        <p><strong>A number of</strong> is followed by a <strong>plural verb</strong> while <strong>The number of</strong> is followed by a <strong>singular verb</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="noun">A number of</span> students <span class="verb">have</span> missed the opportunity to re-register for their courses.</li>

          <li><span class="noun">The number of</span> cars in the car park <span class="verb">has</span> increased dramatically.</li>

      </div>
      <div class="rules">
        <h3>Rule 8:</h3>
        <p>The expression <strong>many a/an</strong> is followed by a singular noun or pronoun and a singular verb.<br>Many a/an=singular noun +singular verb.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Many a <span class="noun">student</span> <span class="verb">likes</span> going on holiday lesson</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From the rule above, when ever "many a/an" is used in a sentence it is followed by a singular noun (Student) and a singular verb (likes).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many a <span class="noun">candidate</span> <span class="verb">fails</span> to realise the difference between written and spoken English.</li>
        </ul>

          <li><strong>More than</strong> <span class="noun">two players</span> <span class="verb">were</span> given a red card.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When ever "more than" is used as the subject, the verb to be used is determined by the noun(either a singular or a plural noun) that comes after "more than".</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>More than </strong> <span class="noun">one student</span> <span class="verb">has</span> paid the fee.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Every <span class="noun">woman</span> <span class="verb">loves</span> her children.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Each <span class="noun">player</span> <span class="verb">was</span> rewarded.</li>
